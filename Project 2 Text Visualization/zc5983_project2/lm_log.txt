Find Unique Words Python

how to count the number of occurrences of each word, and then write out the words that only appear once using python's defaultdict

To count the number of occurrences of each word in a text and then identify words that only appear once using Python's `defaultdict` from the `collections` module, you can follow this approach:

1. **Import defaultdict** from `collections`.
2. Create a `defaultdict` to store word counts with integers as default values.
3. Split the text into words and iterate over them, updating the count in the dictionary.
4. Iterate through the dictionary to find words that appear exactly once.

Here is a Python code example that implements these steps:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample text
text = "hello world hello everyone in the world of python programming"

# Function to count occurrences and find unique words
def find_unique_words(text):
    word_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Split text into words and count occurrences
    words = text.split()
    for word in words:
        word_count[word] += 1
    
    # Find words that appear exactly once
    unique_words = [word for word, count in word_count.items() if count == 1]
    
    return unique_words

# Call the function and print unique words
unique_words = find_unique_words(text)
print("Words that appear only once:", unique_words)
```

This script will output:
```
Words that appear only once: ['everyone', 'in', 'of', 'programming']
```

This demonstrates how to count word occurrences and filter out words that appear only once using `defaultdict`. Adjust the `text` variable to use this code with any text you need to analyze.

The error you're encountering is a `UnicodeDecodeError`, which typically occurs when Python tries to read a file using an incorrect character encoding. The default encoding for Python on Windows is `cp1252`, but it seems that your file contains characters that are not representable in this encoding.

To fix this error, you should specify the encoding of the file when you open it. Most modern text files, especially those that might contain a variety of characters (like books or texts in various languages), are encoded in UTF-8. Here’s how you can modify your code to specify UTF-8 encoding when reading the file:

```python
with open('path_to_your_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    book_text = f.read()
```

Here’s a broader context of how you might use this in a main function:

```python
def main():
    # Assuming 'path_to_your_file.txt' is the path to your text file
    with open('path_to_your_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        book_text = f.read()
    
    # Your processing code here
    # For example, finding unique words
    unique_words = find_unique_words(book_text)
    print("Words that appear only once:", unique_words)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By specifying `encoding='utf-8'` when opening the file, Python will attempt to decode the file using UTF-8 encoding, which should resolve the `UnicodeDecodeError` if your file is indeed encoded in UTF-8. If you continue to experience issues, the file might be in a different encoding, and you might need to check the source of your file or experiment with other encodings like `iso-8859-1`, `ascii`, etc., depending on the file’s origin.
